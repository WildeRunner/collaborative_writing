He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
mina and erik were teaching the #johnny5 bitmaker cohort when suddenly...
A BEAR!!!!!!!!! Two bears actually!
...and...a MOOSE!
and they ate our pizzas!! They were veggie pizzas, so no one cared.
...while Mina and erik offered them coding lessons while they ate.
But since bearsâ€™ hands are too big to use the keyboard, the first bear became mad and the other extremely depressed. Way too depressed for a bear. It is totally uncanny in fact. The mad bear gets even madder cause the sad bear is saying this all out loud and it sounds super pretentious.
